## Inspiration
The thing that inspired our group was the idea that there could be a web app that could help a person find some useful resources around them. The ability to make it easier to go out for a walk easier was our big inspiration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment was learning and being able to use the google map API. Another accomplishment was using node express and react in the project.
